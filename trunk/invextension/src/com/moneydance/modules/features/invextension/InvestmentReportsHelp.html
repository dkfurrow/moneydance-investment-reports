<h1>Investment Reports Extension: Help/Notes:</h1>
The Investment Reports Extension (invextension.mxt) is a set of four useful investment reports which are displayed in
table form or downloaded in .csv form to a directory of the user's choosing. Reports are detailed below, and a basic
overview of classes is provided.&nbsp; Reference website is:&nbsp;<a
        href="http://code.google.com/p/moneydance-investment-reports/">http://code.google.com/p/moneydance-investment-reports/</a>.&nbsp;Email
for more info is: dkfurrow@gmail.com.
<h2>Report Control Panel--Options:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Aggregation Options: Specifies how securities in different accounts will be summarized: choices are:<br>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>USE AGGREGATION METHOD IN SAVED REPORT:&nbsp; Uses
                the aggregation method (as noted in (b)-(d)) that is in the saved report configuration (see Report
                Configuration help below). If one of the options (b)-(d) is selected, that value&nbsp;<span
                        style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">will override whatever value is saved in the selected Report Configuration.</span>
            </li>
            <li>By Investment Account, Then By Tradeable Securities/Account Cash&lt;/i&gt;: Aggregates by Investment
                Account, and then, within each investment account, breaks out performance data for all tradeable
                investments (e.g. Stocks/Bonds/Mutual Funds) and uninvested cash.<span
                        style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span>
            </li>
            <li>Aggregates by Security (regardless of which investment account). For example, if IBM is held in a
                taxable investment account and 401K, the aggregate will show total performance for IBM for both
                accounts.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Basis Options: Determines whether security basis always defaults to average cost, or uses lot matching (on
        accounts where the user has enabled it). Please note that Moneydance currently only offers lot matching on long
        positions.
    </li>
    <li>Download Location: Sets the download location for the Transaction Activity and Security Prices downloads. Note:
        if report generation generates any errors, the log file will also be in the download location.
    </li>
    <li>
        Date Range: A Date Range consists of <i>either</i>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>
                a Rule Input (i.e. sets a reference date and a date rule [e.g."quarter-to-date"]) <i>or</i>
            </li>
            <li>
                Direct Input: A set of fixed dates (from/to dates in the case of the 'From/To' Report, snapshot case in
                the case of the Snapshot Report. <i><b>A Rule Input will override (and automatically refresh) any inputs
                in the Direct Input area.</b></i>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Report Dates: Set effective dates for Snapshot Reports and "From/To" Performance reports, as detailed below.
    </li>
    <li> Reports to Run: Selects which reports to run.<br>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>'From-To' Reports describe investment performance over a prescribed period of time.</li>
            <li>Snapshot Reports describe investment performance on a specific date</li>
            <li>Transaction Activity and Securities Prices are downloaded reports which contain all investment and
                pricing activity, respectively.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Run Reports or Customize<br>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li><b>Run Reports</b> runs selected reports as outlined in (6).</li>
            <li><b>Customize Reports</b> opens the Customize Report Configuration Dialog.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>Customize Report Configuration--Options:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Saved Reports list current saved reports under either the 'From-To' or Snapshot Trees. The default configuration
        is always listed first. Select the default configuration (or other saved configuration) to begin.
    </li>
    <li>Save Current Configuration: Saves all data under the given report name. Please note that the name "default" is
        reserved. The default report cannot be removed or saved over.
    </li>
    <li>Report Name: provide an easy-to-remember name for your report.</li>
    <li>Report Aggregation Options: in accordance with above.</li>
    <li>Show Aggregates for Single Row: If enabled, prints composite report lines even if the composite consists of one
        security (e.g. if IBM is held in only one investment account, the report will include 2 lines for IBM, as a
        single security and as an aggregate). Uncheck to suppress printing of single-security composites.
    </li>
    <li>Display Number Of Frozen Columns: The report output consists of a table with fixed (i.e. non-scrollable) columns
        on the left side. Choose how many columns are fixed.
    </li>
    <li>Hide Closed Positions: Controls whether closed positions are shown in report output.</li>
    <li>Date Range: in accordance with above.</li>
    <li>Field Chooser Tab: Choose which of the available fields will be shown in report output, and the order of viewed
        fields.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>Reports:</h2>

<p>Definitons:</p>

<p>Each report line item represents either a Security or a Composite. A Security represents a unique accounting unit in
    Moneydance. For example, if IBM is held in two different investment accounts, then each holding represents a unique
    Security. A composite is a grouping of securities based on common characteristics. For example, the user can choose
    to aggregate &lt;i&gt;By Ticker&lt;/i&gt;, and that option will form composites of all securities with a common
    ticker (i.e. CurrencyType in the language of the Moneydance API). For the example just cited, the Composite will
    consist of both IBM holdings, presumably held in different investment accounts.<br>
    Color Coding/Hide Closed Positions: Both From/To Report and Portfolio snapshot report use color coding to represent
    Composite. Light Gray represents secondary Composites, Dark Gray represents primary Composites, and Green represents
    All Securities. Secondary Composites combine to produce Primary Composites, and Primary Composites combine to
    produce the ALL Securities line. Double-clicking a security in any report allows the user to edit security
    properties.</p>
<ol>
    <li>"From/To" Report (FromDate, ToDate)<br>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>InvAcct: Investment Account: The investment account in which securities and cash are held.</li>
            <li>Security: Either a designated security, or one of 3 aggregated values:<br>
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                    <li>Securities-ALL represents aggregated securities</li>
                    <li>Securities/CASH-ALL represents aggregated securities plus uninvested cash</li>
                    <li>CASH represents uninvested cash</li>
                </ol>
            </li>

                SecType: User defined Security Type as recorded in Moneydance. Please Note: Security Type and SubType
                are managed in Moneydance at the account level: thus it is entirely possible to characterize the same
                traded security differently in two accounts. For example, IBM can be listed as a "Bond", "Municipal" in
                one account and a "Stock", "Large-Cap" in another. This report is not designed to check for such
                potential discrepancies.

    <li>Total Return:<br>
        Total Return is calculated as shown below.&nbsp; Please note the following<br>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>Ending Market Value (EMV) is calculated as the end position * end price,&nbsp;plus all income and
                expenses associated with the security (securities) during the report period.
            </li>
            <li>Start Date is the later of (a) report start date (b) the date on which the first buy or short sale
                occurs. End Date is the earlier of (a) report end date and (b) the date on which a security position is
                closed.&nbsp; Therefore, changing report start and end dates has no effect on the returns calculation
                for a position which is closed at start or end date, respectively.<br>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    The formula for the Modified Dietz method is as follows:
    <p>R<sub>MDietz</sub> = (EMV-BMV-CF)/[BMV +
        SUMPRODUCT(W<sub>i</sub>*CF<sub>i</sub>)]</p>

    <p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">where:</span><br>
        EMV = ending market value<br>
        BMV = beginning market value<br>
        CF = the net cash flow for the period (contributions to a portfolio are
        entered as positive cash flows while withdrawals are entered as negative cash flows).<br>
        SUMPRODUCT(W<sub>i</sub>*CF<sub>i</sub>)] = the sum of each cash flow, CFi, multiplied by its weight, Wi. <br>
        The weight (Wi) is the proportion of the total number of days in the period that the cash flow CFi is in
        (or out) of the portfolio. <br>
        Wi can be calculated as: W<sub>i</sub> = (CD - D<sub>i</sub>) / CD<br>
        where:<br>
        CD = the number of calendar days during the return period being calculated<br>
        Di = The day in the return period on which the cash flow (CFi) occurred</p>
    <li>
        Annualized Percent Return:<br>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>APR is calculated using the net cash effect (less transfer) or each transaction associated with a
                security (securities), plus the start value and end value associated with the Start and End date as
                noted below.
            </li>
            <li>Start Date is the later of (a) report start date (b) the date on which the first buy or short sale
                occurs. End Date is the earlier of (a) report end date and (b) the date on which a security position is
                closed.&nbsp; Therefore, changing report start and end dates has no effect on the returns calculation
                for a position which is closed at start or end date, respectively.
            </li>
            <li>This calculation method can be replicated by the XIRR function of Microsoft Excel.</li>

        Transaction Entry:<br>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>any expense associated with a buy/sell/short cover/cover short transaction is considered to be a
                commission.
            </li>
            <li>All income and expense associated with an investment account is considered as income (or expense)
                associated with Cash.

    <li>
        Dividend Frequency/ Dividend Calculations:<br>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>Dividend Frequency (which affects annualized dividend, dividend yield calculations) is estimated through
                a heuristic.&nbsp; Multiple dividends which occur within 21 days of each other (such cases as separate
                dividend/capital gains transactions, or dividend corrections) are ignored.&nbsp; The heuristic currently
                assigns one frequency to each security, based on the time between dividends of the last two dividend
                instances.&nbsp; If only one dividend is found, the dividend frequency is assumed to be annual.
            </li>
            <li>Annualized Dividend: The report first calculates the total of the most current dividend (which might
                consist of multiple transactions within an assumed 21 day window, as noted previously).&nbsp; Next an
                annualized Dividend/Share value is calculated, using the position prior to the most recent set of
                dividend transactions (this covers the case of mutual fund dividend/reinvest transactions, where buys
                are recorded coincident with dividends).&nbsp; Finally, the Dividend/Share value is multiplied by the
                current position, in order to get the final value for Annualized Dividend.

<h2>Notes on Classes:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>The Main class registers the extension and passes Moneydance data to other classes.</li>
    <li>The&nbsp;ReportControlFrame class receives the output of Main, creates a frame to hold the report controller
        GUI.
    </li>
    <li>The&nbsp;ReportControlPanel class controls report output: the user selects report parameters, executes reports
        via the Run Reports button.
    </li>
    <li>The&nbsp;BulkSecInfo class contains mapping of investment accounts to security accounts, security accounts to
        transactions, and contains&nbsp;AccountWrapper classes which hold transaction-level and security-level data.&nbsp;&nbsp;BulkSecInfo
        also produces the Securities Prices Report and Transaction Activity Report from these transaction and pricing
        data.
    </li>
    <li>TransactionValues returns one line of data for each parent transaction with buy, sell, short sell, cover short,
        commission, transfer, and security quantity data.<br>
        TransactionValues also create synthetic cash account to record movement of uninvested cash for each Investment
        Account. The initial account balance is recorded as a purchase of cash, and new TransactionValues objects are
        created for each related Security Transaction or Investment Account transaction.&nbsp; For example, a purchase
        of a security and the payment of the related commission creates a sale of the appropriate amount of cash
        (potentially a short-sale if the account does not contain enough cash). All synthetically created
        TransactionValues object have a transaction id of x.1, where x is the transaction number of the primary
        transaction which created the cash transaction.&nbsp; For example if a security purchase has id 121, then the
        corresponding cash sale has id 121.1.<br>
        TransactionValues includes a GainsCalc object (current concrete implementations GainsAverageCalc and
        GainsLotMatchCalc), which calculates long and short basis for a security.
    </li>
    <li>The TotalReport Class is an abstract class holding HashSets of&nbsp; SecurityReport and CompositeReport objects.&nbsp;
        Its concrete implementations are the TotalFromToReport and TotalSnapShotReport.
    </li>
    <li>ComponentReport is an abstract class which is a superclass to both SecurityReport and CompositeReport.</li>
    <li>SecurityReport Class is an abstract class representing one report line of either the From/To or Snapshort
        report.&nbsp; Therefore, its concrete implementations are SecurityFromToReport and SecuritySnapshotReport.&nbsp;
        Note that a SecurityReport can either represent a report line for a leaf-level security or the aggregation line
        for a CompositeReport (described below).
    </li>
    <li>CompositeReport class performs aggregation of one or more leaf-level (i.e. unique security in unique investment
        account) security reports.&nbsp; It holds one placeholder SecurityReport (used to store aggregate data) and
        contains references to all leaf-level SecurityReports aggregated by the CompositeReport.
    </li>
    <li>Aggregator is an interface for the classes which are used to aggregate leaf-level security Reports.&nbsp; To
        accomplish this, Moneydance classes are wrapped in classes which implement Aggregator.&nbsp; The wrapped classes
        are InvestmentAccountWrapper, CurrencyWrapper, SecurityAccountWrapper, Tradeable, SecurityTypeWrapper, and
        SecuritySubTypeWrapper.&nbsp; In this case Tradeable is defined by a single Boolean member false for the
        CurrencyType used to define uninvested cash, true for all other securities.
    </li>
    <li>The&nbsp;DateUtils and&nbsp;IOUtils classes provide useful methods for date math and input/output,
        respectively.
    </li>
    <li>The&nbsp;GoalSeek,&nbsp;GoalSeekData,&nbsp;GoalSeekFunction,&nbsp;XIRR,&nbsp;XIRRData, and&nbsp;XIRRNPV classes
        are all used for calculation of Annualized Percent Return.&nbsp; More info can be found at
        http://gautam.satpathy.org/software/java/jxirr.
    </li>
    <li>The ReportConfigControlFrame, ReportConfigControlPanel, ReportConfigTreePanel, ReportConfigFieldChooserPanel all
        control the process by which a user may generate, update, or delete custom report configurations.
    </li>
    <li>The SecurityAccountEditorForm controls the editing of security properties. Double-clicking on the report display
        generates this form to edit security properties.
    </li>
    <li>ReportOutputTable class implements and enhanced JTable for use in report display.&nbsp; The display implements
        methods so that the columns are sized based on cell data length, the user can fix columns for ease of scrolling,
        closed positions can be either displayed or hidden, and the user may implement a hierarchical sort of data (3
        columns or less).
    </li>
    <li>The Prefs class holds report preferences.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Notes on Test Classes:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>The project supports JUnit testing.&nbsp; Test classes are under the test folder.</li>
    <li>BulkSecInfoTest checks for consistency of transaction data from the test database testMD02.md and stored data in
        csv format.&nbsp; Both the average cost and lot-matching cost accounting methods are supported.
    </li>
    <li>The&nbsp;ReportProdTest class contains 3 tests:&nbsp;testGetFromToReport() and&nbsp;testGetSnapReport() generate
        From/To and Snap reports, respectively, from the MD test database testMD01.md included in the resources folder.&nbsp;
        The generated reports are then compared to saved versions (in csv files) also contained in the resources folder.&nbsp;
        Finally, the&nbsp;testRepSnapAgainstFT&nbsp;generates a Snap Report and compares the columns in that report to
        series of generated From/To reports. This ensures that the Snap Report and FT Reports are producing the same
        data. The class also contains tests which check for consistency between aggregated returns and leaf-level
        security reports for different aggregation methods.
    </li>
    <li>The CheckRepFromTo and&nbsp;CheckRepSnap classes, also in the test folder, are not actually JUnit tests.&nbsp;
        Instead, they output, in tabbed-text form, and exploded view of the From/To and Snap reports, respectively.&nbsp;
        This allows report output to be checked against intermediate calculations.&nbsp; An example of how to do that is
        found in the spreadsheet ReportCheckExample.xlsm&, also found in the resources directory.&nbsp; That spreadsheet
        also breaks down some sample transactions in order to show Mark-to-Market T-account entries.
